## table from econometrics...

| x | y | mathematically | Δx -> | Δy | verbally |
|---|---|----------------|-------|----|----------|
| level | level | Δy=β1Δx | one unit | β1 units | if we change **x by one unit**, we'd expect **y to change by β1 units** |
| level | log   | %Δy=100⋅β1⋅Δx | one unit | 100⋅β1 percent | if we change **x by one unit**, we'd expect **y to change by 100⋅β1 percent** |
| log   | level | Δy=(β1/100)%Δx | one percent | β1/100 units |  if we increase **x by one percent**, we'd expect **y to increase by (β1/100)** units of y |
| log   | log   | %Δy=β1%Δx | one percent | β1 percent | if we change **x by one percent**, we'd expect **y to change by β1 percent** |
